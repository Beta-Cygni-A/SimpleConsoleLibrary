The name "Contra Shell Hard" is not final, would like a better name. Was trying to think of a name that showed it's a Contra like game hard enough to be worthy of the name and that it runs in a shell/command line/terminal...
Maybe rename to to like Contra++ or something to show Contra and C++ and retro and console/ascii
